**Memorite** is a flashcard web application using spaced repetition, a highly effective memorisation technique from cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization. Memorite was developed to be an Anki competitor with more pleasant UI but with less options for customization with the use of plugins.
The main keys of Memorite are:
- Pleasant UI
- Mobile responsive
- Spaced Repetition
