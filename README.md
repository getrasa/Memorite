**Memorite** is a flashcard web application using spaced repetition, a highly effective memorisation technique from cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization. Memorite was developed to be an Anki competitor but with more pleasant UI in return for limited customizability.

## How it works?
There are 8 distinct intervals between reviews ranging from 4 hours to 4 months depending on your proficiency. Successful revision will rise your word proficiency to next level. Similarly, if you make a mistake your level will be decreased also shortening the time you have to wait for your next review. Once you've successfully reviewed a word 8 times it will be Burned - meaning it will never appear in your reviews ever again ðŸ˜­.

Time Intervals are as follows:
- Novice 1 | 4h
- Novice 2 | 8h
- Novice 3 | 23h (1d - 1h)
- Novice 4 | 47h (2d - 1h)
- Proficient 5 | 167h (1w - 1h)
- Advanced 6 | 335h (2w - 1h)
- Superior 7 | 719h (1m - 1h)
- Burned 8 | 2879h (4m - 1h)
